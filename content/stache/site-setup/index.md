# Site Setup

While it is possible for you to create your own Stache site from scratch, typically, you would reach out to one of us on the Stache team and we would create the site and repository and deploy for you.

## Stache new

<pre><code class="language-bash">stache new [project name]</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --production</code></pre>
